# Climate Dashboard — STAT 424 Final Project

This Shiny dashboard investigates two major climate-related questions across multiple countries:

1. **Does higher renewable energy usage correspond to lower CO₂ emissions per capita?**  
2. **Do higher average temperatures correlate with more frequent extreme weather events?**

The dashboard contains two interactive panels that allow users to explore these questions using real-world climate and energy data.

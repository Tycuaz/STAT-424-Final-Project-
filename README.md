# Climate Dashboard — STAT 424 Final Project
This is the final project for Tony Wan's STAT 424 class in the Fall 2025 semester.

This Shiny dashboard investigates two major climate-related questions across multiple countries:
1.Does higher renewable energy usage correspond to lower CO₂ emissions per capita?
2.Do higher average temperatures correlate with more frequent extreme weather events?
The dashboard contains two interactive panels that allow users to explore these questions using real-world climate and energy data.
